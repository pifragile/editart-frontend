                <p>
                    EditArt is an NFT-Platform for generative art, where
                    collectors can co-create a piece of art with the artist
                    using 5 sliders. We focus on minimalistic design, smooth and
                    simple user experience and a no-bullshit, no-scam, high
                    quality space in the crypto jungle.
                </p>

                <h1>Fully on-chain metadata.</h1>
                <p>
                    First an artist creates a parameterized artwork. This
                    artwork will be uploaded to IPFS and the address of it is
                    immutably stored in a custom smart contract deployed for
                    each artwork. If a collector mints a piece, the parameters
                    for the piece are submitted to the smart contract and as
                    well immutably stored on chain. This process ensures full
                    decentralization, but makes it necessary that the token
                    metadata is generated on chain and is the reason why the
                    minting fees are higher that for example in fx(hash).
                    Editart has special priviliges on the contract to set a
                    displayURI and a thumbnailURI for the user's convenience and
                    for a smooth integration into other platforms. The
                    artifactURI on the other hand, which represents the actual
                    NFT, is totally immutable after mint.

                <p>
                    As a collector has some artistic freedom when minting a
                    piece, they will also earn a share of the royalties when the
                    piece is re-sold.

                    Each editart token has its own contract with an included
                    marketplace functionality.
